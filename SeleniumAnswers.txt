

1)What is Selenium?
	1(a).Selenium is a free (open-source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms.
   
  1(b).What are the different Selenium components?	
	Selenium has four major components – Selenium IDE, Selenium RC, Selenium Web driver, Selenium GRID.

  1(c).Explain about Selenium Webdriver?
	Selenium WebDriver is a collection of open source APIs which are used to automate the testing of a web application.
	It supports many browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, IE, and Safari.

2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
	To communicate between server and client (browser), selenium web driver uses JSON. 
	JSON Wire Protocol is a REST API that transfers the information between HTTP servers. Each Browser Driver has its own HTTP server.


3)What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
	-> By CSS ID: find_element_by_id
	-> By CSS class name: find_element_by_class_name
	-> By name attribute: find_element_by_name
	-> By DOM structure or xpath: find_element_by_xpath
	-> By link text: find_element_by_link_text
	-> By partial link text: find_element_by_partial_link_text
	-> By HTML tag name: find_element_by_tag_name


4) Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
	 Because ID is considered as unique key so there cannot be more than 1 elements for same ID while Xpath is created using relative path/position of elements, 
	 so there can be cases when we can get 2 or more elements for same Xpath.

5)How to select value in dropdown?
  We select value in dropdown by Instantiate the drop-down box as an object, Select in Selenium WebDriver and(selctbyvisibletext,selectByIndex
      ,selectByValue) method.We can Declare the drop-down element as an instance of the Select class




6) What is the difference between Absolute X-Path and Relative X-Path?
	
	Absolute X-Path:
	     It uses Complete path from the Root Element to the desire element.
	
	Relative X-path:
	    You can start by referencing name of the element you want and go from there.


7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not?

   First we need to check the DOM method such as getElementById() and many like this.By we can know the chckbox is selceted or not 
   for exaple:isSelected method is used to check wheather the checkbox is slected or not.




8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager?

   *WebDriverManager automates the browser setup in the Selenium code. 
   *By default, it downloads the latest version of the browser binary and also the binary for the appropriate platform
   *We have to add the dependency for WebDriverManager in case the code belongs to Maven or Gradle environment.
   System.setProperty:
    *It is used to configure the browser driver path. 
    *The Selenium client library communicates with the ChromeDriver via the JSON Wire Protocol. 
    *The Chrome browser driver acts like a link between the Selenium implementation code and the Chrome browser


9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths?
   preceding xpath:
                   //input[text()='madhusuda']//preceding sibiling::input
  following xpath:
                   //label[text()='madhusudan']//following sibing::label


10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
	To get the attribute value using selenium webdriver, we can use 'element. getAttribute(attributeName)'. 
	If we try to get the attribute value that doesn't exists for the tag, it will return null value
